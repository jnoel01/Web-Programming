            <h2> Short Intro to Me </h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Jessica Noel! I am currently a junior at Stevens Institute of Technology studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. 
                I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. If you’re familiar with the area, I’m specifically from Park Slope! I went to Hunter High School
                located on 71 E 94th St in Manhattan for the first part of my schooling. My parents sillily decided to move to Staten Island, which I like to
                call Shitten Island and I transferred my schooling to Wagner High School which made me super sad. During my transition and move I started picking 
                up old things that I used to love to do, like art and music as well as reading! My favorite type of art is Expressionism and Modern Art. My favorite 
                artists are Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and ​​Theo van Doesburg. In terms of music, I like EVERYTHING except country… I grew up listening to classic 
                rock with my dad, so I’m a huge fan of that genre. But I also love Electronic Dance Music, Indie, classical and really trashy rap. Because I enjoy 
                the arts a lot and I am indeed a stem major (who wants to do more analytics stuff with cs), I try to incorporate art into my code. Which is 
                why I enjoy Web Dev, you can add your own style to things! That’s enough about me.
