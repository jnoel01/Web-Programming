            <p>I'm not sure, this was so long ago, maybe Computer Class
                because we got to play math games.

            I remember someone slapped me in latchkey, which if you don't know latchkey is an afterschool program for kids who get picked up late. 
            So I was playing basketball in latchkey and I beat him so he slapped me and we both went to the principals office.

            <h2>Hunter College High School</h2>
            <p>Biology was sick</p>

                So many stories from this school, but one that sticks out was the school snowball fight. Typically only seniors go to this but I skipped 
                class and went. It was just such a pure moment, everyone was so happy to be with their friends and literally just being kids and throwing 
                snowballs in Central Park.

            <h2>Susan E Wagner High School</h2>
            <p>My AP Psychology Class was hilarious</p>
            <aside>
                There were just a lot of fights at this school. I remember one time after a basketball game this kid started a fight with the other team.
                I was working the snack stand that game, but as I was walking out into the hall I saw the two kids who fought in the Deans office. The kid ended 
                up punching the glass of the door in as I walked by and it shattered all over me. Not the best night lol.

                A good memory I had with my friend Jack, who's also in this class was in the basement of a frat on a Friday night. We were playing pong and the opposite 
                team finished all our cups. Jack and I had to sink 5 to win. I shot for him because he went to use the bathroom. We kept getting balls back and he missed 
                the last cup so it was up to me to hit it, an of course, I got it in. The whole basement screamed and it was a core memory even though it was stupid.
