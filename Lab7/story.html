    <h1>The Time I Got a Pet Turtle</h1>>
    <main>
        <p>Hello, I'm am Jessica Noel and I've been dying to tell you a story about the time I got a pet turtle. I was about 
            17 years old and at the time I wanted a pet sooo bad but my parents wouldn't let me get one because everyone that 
            lives in my house is allergic. To set the stage, I was in Great Kills Park in Staten Island, New York. My dad and 
            I had just finished doing our weekly bike ride. Normally we bike to our parked car which is at the exit of the park 
            but this time we parked the car closer, this was the best decision ever.
        </p>
        <p>My dad and I start packing the car and pulling out all the snacks for the drive home. I hop in the car and chug my water 
            and then we were on our way home. This is where the story gets exciting... As we're driving we hear someone yell "TURTLE, 
            WATCH OUT! THERE'S A TURTLE THERE!!". My dad and I SLAM on the breaks and get out of the car. There was just a turtle sitting 
            on the road hiding in it's shell. My dad just picked the turtle up and put him in a towel then threw him in the back of 
            the car. I was pretty shocked, knowing my dad, he kinda hates animals. I asked him "Hey Dad? Why did you put the turtle in the 
            car?". His response was "He's better off in the car than he is on the road". I then obviously pleaded to keep this turtle.

            Eventually, my dad budged and said we could keep the turtle. But ONLY in the backyard. I was ecstatic, my very own pet. I named 
            him Skumpy. We kept Skumpy in the backyard. We would feed Mr. Skumps lettuce every day. I'd walk outside before school and wave to Skumpy 
            and scream "bye!". One day though, my "bye" was the last bye I'd ever say. I came back from school and noticed there was a hole in the dirt 
            under the fence. Skumpy had escaped under our fence. I was devastated... My first turtle, gone. RIP SKUMPS. 4 ever in my heart.
